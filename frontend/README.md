## Setup

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### 2. Configure API URL

In `src/api/axios.js` and `src/api/useApi.js`, update the `baseURL` to match your backend:

```js
baseURL: "http://localhost:5000/api"; // development
// baseURL: "https://your-backend.railway.app/api"  // production
```

### 3. Run the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Pages

### `/` — HomePage

Static landing page with app introduction and a link to sign in.

### `/auth` — AuthPage

Flip card animation with login on the front and signup on the back. Rotating quotes at the bottom. Redirects to `/dashboard` on success.

### `/dashboard` — DashboardPage

Masonry grid of journal entries with:

- Live debounced search (400ms delay)
- Pagination (9 entries per page)
- Skeleton loading state
- Empty state with call to action

### `/entry/:id` — EntryDetailPage

Renders all blocks in order. Images start as thumbnails and expand on click. Videos show as a compact pill that expands a player below. Edit and delete buttons at the bottom.

### `/create` — CreateEntryPage

Block-based editor:

- `+ Text` adds a new auto-growing textarea
- `📷 Media` opens the camera modal
- Between-block `+ Text` / `+ Media` buttons appear on hover
- Fixed bottom toolbar with Save button

### `/entry/:id/edit` — EditEntryPage

Same editor as Create but pre-populated with existing entry data. Existing media blocks show their Cloudinary thumbnails. New media blocks can be added alongside existing ones.

## Auth Flow

1. On app load, `AuthContext` checks localStorage for a refresh token
2. If found, calls `/api/auth/refresh` to restore the session silently
3. Access token is kept in React state and a `tokenRef` for synchronous access
4. `useApi` hook attaches the token to every request via axios interceptor
5. On 401, the interceptor automatically refreshes the token and retries (except for multipart requests)
6. On logout, refresh token is deleted from both the backend and localStorage

---

## Camera Modal

The camera modal uses the browser's `MediaDevices API`:

- Requests camera + microphone permission on open
- **Photo mode** — captures a canvas snapshot as JPEG
- **Video mode** — records using `MediaRecorder`, saves as WebM
- **Flip camera** — switches between front/rear if multiple cameras are detected
- **Error state** — falls back to file upload if camera is unavailable or permission is denied
- File upload accepts both `image/*` and `video/*` — type is auto-detected from `file.type`

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

Output goes to `dist/`. Deploy this folder to Vercel, Netlify, or any static host. Make sure to update the `baseURL` in the axios config to point to your production backend before building.
